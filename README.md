# Hey! I'm Gabriel 👋

**Senior Software Engineer** with 10+ years building web applications at scale

I am a computer engineer who loves understanding systems end-to-end — from frontend pixels to backend services, from cloud infrastructure to bare metal. I write code professionally and reverse engineer hardware and software for fun.

Take a look at my blog:

## 💼 Professional Work

I've spent over a decade building and scaling web applications, working across the entire stack:

- **Frontend Development** — Building responsive, performant user interfaces with modern frameworks
- **Backend Development** — Designing APIs, microservices, and data pipelines
- **Observability & Monitoring** — Implementing comprehensive monitoring with tools like NewRelic, crafting NRQL queries, and tracking down production issues
- **Technical Leadership** — Mentoring developers, driving architectural decisions, and collaborating with stakeholders

## 🔬 After Hours

When I'm not shipping production code, I run a home lab that would make a small startup jealous (jk):

- 🏠 **Infrastructure** — Proxmox clusters, TrueNAS with ZFS pools, self-hosted everything
- 📹 **Video Surveillance** — Frigate NVR with AI object detection and hardware acceleration
- 🔐 **Security Research** — Reverse engineering firmware, wireless pentesting, hardware hacking
- 📡 **Radio & Networking** — SDR experiments with HackRF One, WiFi security analysis

## 🎓 Academic Background

**B.Sc. Computer Engineering** — PUCRS (Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul)

My thesis bridged my professional and personal interests: a **[solar-powered IoT phishing awareness system](https://github.com/radzki/SunPhish)** that educates users about social engineering attacks. It involved ESP8266 development, reverse engineering firmware with Ghidra, and building a fully self-sufficient embedded system.
